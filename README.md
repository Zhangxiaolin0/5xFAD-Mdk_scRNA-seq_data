Project Description
This repository contains the analysis code for single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from brain tissue and 
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from microglia of 5xFAD mice with and without Mdk (Midkine) knockout. 
The study investigates the role of Mdk in Alzheimer's disease pathology using the 5xFAD mouse model.
